      Hello ðŸ‘‹
      <br /><br />
      My name is Colby Haskell. I am a Software Engineer with experience in DevOps, Embedded Software, and Web Development.
      I studied <Link text="Computer Engineering and Computer Science B.S." to="https://viterbischool.usc.edu" /> at the <Link text="University of Southern California" to="https://www.usc.edu" />.
      <br /><br />
      I currently work at <Link text="Draper" to="https://www.draper.com" /> as a Simulation
      Software Engineer, volunteer at <Link text="TransitMatters" to="www.transitmatters.org" />,
      and contribute to open-source projects such as <Link text="nlohmann/json" to="https://github.com/nlohmann/json" />.
      <br /><br />
      I work with C++, TypeScript, and Python most often, but I have experience with a range of other languages.
      Technologies I use, among others, include Docker, Linux, Gitlab CI, CMake, and Node.
      <br /><br />
